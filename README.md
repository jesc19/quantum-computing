In this repository I have unploaded basic introductory codes to quantum computing using Python and Qiskit


# 1.-Grover algorithm

Grover algorithm is one of most famous simples codes in quantum computing, due to the fact that it shows the adventages of quantums algorithms over the classical .

In this code we build the logic gates which allows us to choose with a greater probability a state consisting of 3 qbits.

You need to put the input state formed by:
q0=0 or 1

q1=0 or 1

q3=0 or 1

q4=0 or 1
